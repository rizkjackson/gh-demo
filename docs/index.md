# TIPCC - a High-Performance Compute Environment at UCSF

At the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center we have a large Linux compute cluster that is available to anyone affiliated with the Cancer Center - feel free to [contact us] if you would like to [join] or have questions.

As of February 2017, the cluster has 28 nodes and ~1,100 cores, which predominantly are AMD processors. Each node has up to 512 GiB of RAM and up to 7 TiB of fast local disk space. In addition to ~90 TiB global disk space shared among all users, several research groups have disk space of their own mounted to the cluster.  For more details, see [Cluster Hardware] and [Operating System & Scheduler].
